# VafixEngine
A game engine/framework made in java using LWJGL by mqxf and a few random people he found who wanted to help. It is still WIP, I will add Javadocs for it later, as well as maybe making it a full engine. For now it would be used by importing it as a dependency to the project you want to make a game in.

I'll add documentation later
